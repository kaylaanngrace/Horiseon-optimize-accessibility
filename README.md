Horiseon-Optimize-Accessibility

DESCRIPTION:
My motive for this project is to become more efficent in web development/coding. 

I'm refactoring the code to opitmize in search engine, adding accessiblity features and cleaning up working code. 

This project will make the already built webpage more accessible to everyone who comes across it, including those with disabilites. 

LEARNED/LEARNING:
I've learned that non-semantic elements like <div> and <span>, don't add to the experience for people with disabilities. I learned having an <img> elemet, without an alt atrribute can hide important context from screenreaders. I also learned that the internet can be accessible to all people of all kinds if coded correctly and effiecently. Another thing I learned is that having a more accessible code can improve the webpages SEO. 

PROCCESS/INSTALLTION:
The first step I took in refactoring this code, was interesting comments to visually divide both the HTML and CSS files and making sure the links worked properly. The second step I took was changing the some of the elements to semantic elements, ie. <div> to <nav> and <div class=header> to <header>. The next step, was to change the selectors on the CSS file to match the HTMl file. Then, I condensed code that was repeated into similar CSS declarations. Finally, I am researching and adding accessibility elements.

USAGE: 
At the top of the page there is a hidden skiplink that allows you to skip to the main content of the page. If you press tab, the link will appear, if you press enter it will bring you to the main content of the page.
